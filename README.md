# Compilation Project

## Overview

This repo is a Compilation Project  for school. This project is designed to demonstrate the implementation of a lexical analyzer for `.plic` source files. It includes a `Scanner` utility to parse through the file line by line and identify keywords, skipping over comments denoted by `//`.

## Getting Started

To begin working with this project, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. Then, compile the Java classes and run the main program.

## Usage

To use the lexical analyzer, instantiate the `AnalyseurLexical` class with the path to your `.plic` source file. The analyzer will then process the file, extract keywords, and store them for later retrieval. You can view the extracted keywords by calling the `afficherMotsCles()` method.
